      <h2>Senior Frontend Developer</h2>

      <p class="text-left px-4 mb-4">
        I'm a software developer with 4+ years of web development. 
        I'm proficient in JavaScript, Vue 2, and have worked with Vue 3, 
        Node, Express, and TypeScript. <br /> <br />
        I started to work with React, but Vue stole my heart. 
        I have been working with Vue 2 over 3 years. <br /> <br />
        My goal is delivering the best possible user experience, performance, and intuitiveness in the products I develop. <br /> <br />
        My key points are carefully assess every detail of the design and user scenarios, pay attention for performance issues,
        know exactly how the product must work. <br /> <br />

        Iâ€™m convinced that attention to detail is critical. 
        Overlooking the small things can lead to a product that fails to meet user needs, regardless of its size or scope. <br /> <br />

        What are my expectations? <br />

        - user oriented development<br />
        - the developer should do what the business needs<br />
        - paid overtime
        <br /> <br />
